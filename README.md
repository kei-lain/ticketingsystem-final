# ticketingsystem-final

This is a help desk ticketing system built in django. Using Oauth2, users are able to sign in and or register. Users are only able to see their own tickets their create and employees (dictated by the admin) are able to complete tickets. Users should also receive an email when the ticket is set to complete. Currently working on the frontend.
